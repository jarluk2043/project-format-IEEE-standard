To My Students who are doing Their project should follow the these guidelines.
                               Project structure for BIT  
Cover page 
Note that the cover page should not show a page number.  
Approval certificate Acknowledgements  
It is normal to thank those who have given help and support (typically your supervisor). Keep acknowledgements short and business-like.  
Abstract  
This should be not more than one page in length. The abstract should allow the reader who is unfamiliar with the work to gain a swift and accurate impression of what the project is about, how it arose and what has been achieved.  
List of Tables/Figures  
If the report contains figures or tables a list of these should be provided. The list should give the table or figure number, the title of the table or figure and the page number. If only a few tables and figures are present, they may be treated on one page. Remember that all figures and tables used must be referred to in the text. For example “The class diagram shown in 
Figure 2.1 ....”

References  
There should always be a list of all books, articles and technical resources consulted. The use of all source material should be explicit in the report. This means that normally ever item in the reference list will be referred to in the report and every item mentioned in the report will have an entry in the reference list.  Use IEEE citation style for references 
[1] J. K. Author, “Title of paper,” Abbrev. Title of Journal, vol. x, no. x, pp. xxx-xxx, Abbrev.  Month, year. 
 
For example: 
[1] J. H. Smith and K. W. Tang, “Efficient algorithms for sorting and synchronization,” IEEE   Trans. Computers, vol. 50, no. 3, pp. 274-285, Mar. 2001. 
 
In this example: 
•	J. H. Smith and K. W. Tang are the authors. 
•	"Efficient algorithms for sorting and synchronization" is the title of the paper. 
•	IEEE Trans. Computers is the abbreviated title of the journal. 
•	Volume 50, Number 3, pages 274 to 285 are the details of the journal. 
•	March 2001 is the publication date. 
Appendices /Annex 
List screenshots of the project. 
 Note: Screenshots should have figure number and name. 
 
Report Format Standards: 
A.	Page Number   
•	The pages from certificate page to the list of   tables/figures/abbreviations/approvals should be numbered in roman starting  from i.  
•	The pages from chapter 1 onwards should be numbered in numeric starting  from 1. The page number should be inserted at bottom, aligned center.   
B.	Page Size and Margin   
•	The paper size must be a page size corresponding to A4.   
•	The margins must be set as   
•	Top = 1 in (2.54 cm)   
•	Bottom = 1 in (2.54 cm)   
•	Left = 1.25 in (3.17 cm)   
•	Right = 1 in (2.54 cm)   
C.	Paragraph Style   
• All paragraphs must be justified and have spacing of 1.5.   
D.	Text Font of Document   
•	The contents in the document should be in Times New Roman font   
•	The font size in the paragraphs of document should be 12   
E.	Section Headings   
•	Font size for the headings should be 16 for chapter headings, 14 for section  headings, 12 for sub-section headings.   
•	All the headings should be bold faced.   
F.	Figures and Tables   
•	Position of figures and tables should be aligned center.   
•	The figure caption should be centered below the figure and table captions  should be centered above the table.   
•	All the captions should be of bold face with 9 font size & font face italic. 
Notes: 
•	Start new chapter from new page. 
•	Save document in pdf format before print. 
 
 
 
Guideline For Effective Slide: 
•	One Main Topic Per Slide: Each slide should focus on one main point or idea. Keep it simple, don't overload slides with too much information. 
•	Clear Headings: Use clear and concise headings to tell what each slide is about. Headings should summarize the main point of the slide. 
•	Use Simple Transition:  Stick to simple transitions that complement your presentation without being overwhelming. 
•	Use Bullet Points: Instead of long sentences or paragraphs, use bullet points to list key ideas. Keep each bullet point short and to the point. 
•	Big Fonts: Make sure the text on your slides is big enough to read from a distance. Use a simple font like Arial or Calibri, and make the font size at least 24pt.  
•	Pictures Speak Louder: Use pictures or images to show what you're talking about. A picture can often explain things better than words. This doesn’t mean totally overwhelm your slide with pictures. In general, try to maintain a ratio of 70% text & 30% image. 
•	Consistent Design: Keep the design of your slides consistent. Use the same colors, fonts, and layout throughout your presentation.
